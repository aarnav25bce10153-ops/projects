## Problem Statement
   Many new learners and educators want to understand how numbers decompose into digits and understand the process of mapping digits back to their originating numbers in a sequence. There is no simple interactive tool for demonstrating this mapping in a hands-on way.
## Scope of the Project
   This Python program helps users generate a digit list from numbers within a specified range and trace each digit to its original number. The scope is limited to simple digit          decomposition, mapping, and basic interactive querying within integer ranges.
## Target Users
  The primary users are programming beginners, students, and educators exploring number systems, digit extraction, and fundamental data mapping concepts. It can also assist those interested in puzzles or basic programming logic demonstrations.
## High-level Features
  -Interactive input and output sequence.
  -Creates a digit list from integer values in a specified range.
  -Maintains and displays a mapping from each digit to its originating number.
  -Supports user queries for retrieving the original number from a digit index.
  -Handles basic input validation for improved usability.
